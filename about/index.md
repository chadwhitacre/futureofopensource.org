Greetings! My name is Chad Whitacre. I'm a software developer and the Head of
Open Source at [Sentry](https://sentry.io/welcome/). 

I got my start in Open Source in 2001. I participated in the Python web
development boom in the 2000s that gave rise to Django and Flask. Along the
way, I experienced first-hand the tension between volunteer Open Source work
and paid closed source work, so I spent the 2010s on a crowdfunding startup I
founded called [Gittip (later Gratipay)](https://gratipay.com/). Now here in
the 2020s my role is Head of Open Source at Sentry, an application monitoring
company with deep roots in the Open Source community.

On this website, I blog and host **important conversations about topics that
matter** to the Open Source community, the wider tech industry, and society at
large.

Thanks for visiting! ðŸ’ƒ
