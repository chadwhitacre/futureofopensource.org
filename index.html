    <p> Greetings! My name is <a href="/about/">Chad Whitacre</a>, and I'm Head
    of Open Source at <a href="https://sentry.io/welcome/">Sentry</a>. At
      Sentry we believe that companies should <b>fund their dependencies</b>.
      We also think it's time to converge on <b>source-available licensing</b>
      options. This website is a venue to pursue these goals.
