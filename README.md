### Welcome!

This repo holds the source code for
[futureofopensource.org](https://futureofopensource.org/), where I host
important conversations about topics that matter to the Open Source community,
the wider tech industry, and society at large. If you have questions or
suggestions, feel free to [open an
issue](https://github.com/chadwhitacre/futureofopensource.org/issues/new), or
reach out on [email](mailto:chadwhitacre@sentry.io) or
