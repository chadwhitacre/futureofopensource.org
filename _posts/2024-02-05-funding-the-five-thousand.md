title: Funding the Five Thousand
excerpt: Pricing to cost is a more pragmatic solution to the OSS sustainability crisis than pricing to value.

A number of years ago, I did some napkin math on [the value created by Open
Source](https://gratipay.news/open-source-captures-almost-none-of-the-value-it-creates-9015eb7e293e),
in order to come up with a "[fair
share](https://gratipay.news/your-company-should-probably-pay-2000-per-person-for-open-source-9205443e209d)"
amount that companies should be paying projects. Last month, researchers from Harvard
Business School (HBS) published [a working paper with a similar
scope](https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=4693148).  I have
[serious questions about their
work](http://localhost:4000/2024/questioning-the-value-of-open-source-software/),
but, to be honest, both of our attempts are really hand-wavy. 

Some of the details of the HBS paper got me thinking, though. They claim,
credibly enough, that there are only a few thousand developers that produce all
of Open Source (forgive me for rounding up a little bit for the purposes of a
catchy title üòå).

If there are only a few thousand maintainers, then solving the sustainability
crisis should be quite a tractable problem to approach from the bottom up (who
are they and what do they need?) rather than the top down (how much do we
estimate Open Source is worth?).

In other words, let's see if we can **price to cost** instead of to value. In
general, that leaves value on the table, but we're not trying to maximize
profit for Open Source as if it were a business. We're trying to make it
[sustainable](/2024/the-open-source-sustainability-crisis/#what-is-open-source-sustainability):

## Narrowing Our Focus

Let's focus on developing a system for fairly paying _the actual maintainers we
have today_ without making them jump through hoops. If we develop the system
right, then additional individuals will be able to join in on their own terms
in the future, and we will have achieved sustainability as I've defined it.
Accomplishing this will accelerate adjacent efforts such as improving security
and diversity.

The main source of funds is going to be companies, with governments and
philanthropies as secondary sources. The main target of funding should be
projects, whether directly through foundations or indirectly through funding
platforms.

The problem of getting funds from projects to people is a problem of
governance. This is quite important but should largely be hidden from
companies. Companies should fund projects, because that's what they depend on
and care about. If a maintainer moves on from a project then the funds should
be available to [incentivize someone else to step up and take it
over](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e5FV-AnKPlo).

## Next Steps

Here's a GitHub issue for [figuring out the fair share
amount](https://github.com/chadwhitacre/openpath/issues/20) based on the few
thousand maintainers we actually have today. [Andrew
Nesbitt](https://nesbitt.io/) from [Ecosyste.ms](https://ecosyste.ms/) is [in
there](https://github.com/chadwhitacre/openpath/issues/20#issuecomment-1919926941)
so you know it's [going to be
good](https://github.com/chadwhitacre/openpath/issues/20#issuecomment-1921286147).

need a new institution or what.
