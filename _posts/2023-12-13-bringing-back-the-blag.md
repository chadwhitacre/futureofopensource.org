I bought my first domain name in April, 2000. Today <a
href="https://whit537.org/">whit537.org</a> redirects here, along with <a
href="https://zetaweb.com/">zetaweb.com</a>, the domain I've used for
<a href="mailto:chad@zetaweb.com">email</a> since setting it up for the web
shop I cofounded in 2002. I started blogging on <a
href="https://web.archive.org/web/20070801000000*/blag.whit537.org">blag.whit537.org</a>
in October, 2006, publishing in other venues as well over the years. For the past
few years I've kept my personal website simple, but today I'm bringing back the
blag.

Why start blogging again? It's for work, to be honest. I woke up to find myself
Head of Open Source at Sentry, and in my role I need a place to engage publicly
without clogging up the company blog. Let this be it!

I've also [dusted off my YouTube
channel](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3kAh6N9D6WA). Looking back, "open
calls" were ahead of their time. I look forward to getting back into it here in
the age of streaming.


### Themes

What content can you expect? I plan to talk about Open Source, of course,
especially funding, licensing, and sustainability‚Äîprimary concerns for Sentry.
I think there's a lot unexplored in how [Govering the
Commons](https://www.amazon.com/dp/0521405998) applies to Open Source. I have a
mind to start participating more in Open Source Initiative goings-on.

Beyond but related to Open Source, I'm interested in the concept of a
post-scarcity economy and how to transition to it. Sentry is not really an
[Open Company](https://github.com/opencompany/awesome-open-company), but I
still think these are interesting. I may still occasionally post about actual
tech.

I also intend to republish old posts from various other venues as time and
copyright holders permit.


### How to Follow Along

For now [X/Twitter](https://twitter.com/chadwhitacre_) is the best way to find
out about new content. If there's demand I can see about publishing to RSS or
email or whatever. In addition to X, [email](mailto:chad@zetaweb.com) and
[GitHub](https://github.com/chadwhitacre/chadwhitacre.com/issues/new) are great
ways to let me know your own thoughts.

Alright! I'm back! Cheers! üçª
