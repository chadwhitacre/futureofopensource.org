title: The Birth of the American Empire
excerpt: We may have just witnessed the end of the Republic, with the accession of Augustus Musk.

Yesterday I [commented on point
four](/2025/point-four-of-elons-fork-is-the-scary-one/) of Elon Musk's "[Fork
in the Road](https://www.opm.gov/fork)" document.
"[Fork](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fork_(software_development))" is a
technical term in Open Source software that refers to a schism in the community
behind a project. Point four quite possibly signals [the end of the rule of
law](/2025/point-four-of-elons-fork-is-the-scary-one/) in the United States of
America. What comes after? Empire.

## Hail Caesar

Elon's supporters [recognize his gesture at the inauguration as a Roman
salute](https://theconversation.com/elon-musk-and-the-history-of-the-roman-salute-248032).

The [Roman Republic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roman_Republic) ended in 27
BC when Octavian took the title [Augustus
Caesar](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Augustus), inaugurating the [Roman
Empire](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roman_Empire):

> The reign of Augustus initiated an imperial cult, as well as an era of
> imperial peace (the _Pax Romana_ or _Pax Augusta_) in which the Roman world
> was largely free of armed conflict.

I strongly suspect that in Elon's mind, January 20, 2025 was the end of the
American Republic, and the birth of the American Empire.

## So What?

A few brief comments on what seems (from so close to it) to be one of the
pivotal moments of human history:

1. Many will accept Musk's rise to power as good news.

1. I don't see this change being forcibly reverted. The noise from those who
   don't accept Musk will likely subside to a manageable simmer relatively soon.

1. [Unlike Rome](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/War_of_Actium), this transition
   happened without an overt war, which is good.

1. Elon seems to me likely to succeed in making the U.S. more efficient and
   effective, based on his success with Twitter and his other companies.

1. Elon is likely to use his new power primarily to pursue his [interplantary
   agenda](https://nss.org/elon-musk-making-humans-a-multiplanetary-species/).

1. Succession is the inefficient operation of empire. Clearly Musk has
   positioned himself to succeed Trump. Who succeeds Musk? According to what
   process?

1. It hasn't happened yet, but he indicated he would return Twitter to a public
   company after reorganizing it as X. Is there a world in which he returns the
   U.S. to a republic once he has run his course?

1. This is a particularly salient time to worship a deity other than Caesar.
