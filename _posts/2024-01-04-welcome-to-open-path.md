title: Welcome to Open Path
excerpt: Open Path is a new blog by Chad Whitacre about Open Source, tech, and society
---

Greetings! Welcome to [Open Path](/). The purpose of this blog is to contribute
to important conversations about topics that matter to the Open Source
community, the wider tech industry, and society at large. In this intro post
I'll give you a little background on myself, and sketch the big picture for the
direction of this blog.

## A Little About Me

<img src="/assets/chadwhitacre.jpg" class="float-left"> My name is [Chad
Whitacre](https://chadwhitacre.com/), and I've been involved in Open Source
since 2001, soon after Christine Peterson [coined the
term](https://opensource.com/article/18/2/coining-term-open-source-software). I
participated in the Python web development boom in the 2000s that gave rise to
Django and Flask. During this time, I experienced first-hand the tension
between volunteer Open Source work and paid closed source work, so I spent the
2010s as founder of a crowdfunding startup called Gittip (later Gratipay). Now,
here in the 2020s, I am Head of Open Source at
[Sentry](https://sentry.io/welcome/), an application monitoring company with
deep roots in the Open Source community.

In the past I've published on the [Gittip](https://blog.gittip.com/) and
[Gratipay](https://gratipay.news) blogs, as well as [on
OpenSource.com](https://opensource.com/users/whit537). In my current role I
publish [on Sentry's blog](https://blog.sentry.io/authors/chad-whitacre/), but
there is more I need to say than makes sense to post there. With Open Path I am
establishing a platform for myself to explore themes in Open Source and beyond.

## Why? So I Won't Get Fined

To be honest, I'm irrationally terrified to start blogging again. A
psychologist evaluated me in 2018 (a routine part of kidney donation). He
diagnosed me with PTSD from all of the online conflict related to the end of
Gittip (Gratipay). 2015‚Äì2017 did, in fact, suck.

In one sense, then, [I'm just here so I won't get
fined](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rmABbHSOTqQ). I work for Sentry, and my job
requires me to be a "thought leader," so I need a platform. Others at Sentry
have theirs:

- [David Cramer](https://cra.mr/)‚Äî[technical
  co-founder](https://github.com/getsentry/sentry/commit/3c2e87573d3bd16f61cf08fece0638cc47a4fc22), my boss
- [Armin Ronacher](https://lucumr.pocoo.org/)‚Äî[employee
  1](https://blog.sentry.io/welcome-armin-ronacher/), principle architect
- [Ben
  Vinegar](https://benv.ca/)‚Äî[employee
  2](https://blog.sentry.io/welcome-ben-vinegar/), my former boss

Those are theirs. This is mine.

Now, I'm a mission-driven guy. I naturally tend to want to relate my work in
the world back to crisp fundamentals. Sentry's mission is **to enable
developers to ship with confidence**, so that guides my work in Open Source at
Sentry.

Our Open Source Program Office (OSPO) has four programs:

1. _Self-hosted._ Our business model is SaaS, but we want all developers to be
   able to use Sentry and Codecov. My team is responsible for our self-hosted
   offerings, which are suitable out-of-the-box for small-volume and
   proof-of-concept deployments, and can serve as blueprints for more robust
   setups.

1. _Community engagement._ Open Source is the de facto development model for
   developers society-wide. Practically speaking, my team maintains GitHub
   automations to help us stay on top of inbound issues.

1. _Licensing and compliance._ We work closely with Legal to ensure compliance
   with the terms of the licenses of the components we use, and to properly
   license the software we ourselves produce.

1. _Funding._ We give lots of money to Open Source projects. It's fun.

I see (1) as directly related to our mission. My team "enables developers" by
making Sentry and Codecov available to use in a way they couldn't otherwise. I
see (2) as one degree removed. When developers have trouble using our products,
we want to hear about it, so we can help them out and potentially improve the
products.

I see (3) and (4) as further removed from Sentry's mission, narrowly
understood. Our licensing and funding activities do not directly help Sentry
and Codecov users ship their own software with confidence. If you squint, you
could be like, "Well, Sentry and Codecov need a strong Open Source supply chain
in order to be stable products." Meh, maybe. I think this only really gets
interesting when we start talking about the state of the Open Source ecosystem
as a whole, beyond just our own products.

Broadly understood, Sentry's mission includes solving the Open Source
sustainability crisis. We enable developers to ship with confidence:

- for developers in general, confidence in the security and overall quality of
  their Open Source dependencies; and
- for noncommercial Open Source developers, confidence that we've collectively,
  financially got their back.

Both are way bigger than Sentry, and that's where thought leadership enters my
job description. Hence, this blog.

## Really Why? The Lens of Love

Sentry's mission is to enable developers to ship with confidence, but this is
my platform, not Sentry's. These are my opinions, not those of my employer.
What is my mission? What are the fundamentals I care about?

I wrote about this when Gratipay was dying its slow death.
[**Love**](https://opensource.com/open-organization/16/9/openness-means-to-what-end)
is the word. That's the lens I come back to, trite and loaded as it may be.
Open Source is not an end in itself. To get from Open Source to Love and back,
we have a lot of ground to cover:

- will
- trust
- unity
- voices
- service
- conflict
- scarcity
- fairness
- legalism
- activism
- freedom
- diversity
- gratitude
- authority
- hierarchy
- humanity
- producers
- obedience
- resistance
- generosity
- journalism
- economics
- consumers
- community
- submission
- resentment
- productivity
- employment
- corporations
- post-scarcity
- sustainability
- confrontation
- future of work
- platform decay
- open companies
- exit to community
- individual and group
- governing the commons

Like I say, I naturally tend to want to relate my work in the world back to
fundamentals. If I'm going to blog in my own voice on my own platform, I'm not
sure how I'll be able to avoid going down rabbit holes such as these. üê∞üï≥Ô∏è

I do think Open Source is one of the most interesting things going right now,
precisely because it does touch on so many fundamental questions about what it
means to be human in the world. I'm terrified at the prospect of engaging these
questions publicly‚Äîto press the metaphor, this path seems to be starting out along the
edge of a cliff!

Hopefully [Open Path](https://openpath.chadwhitacre.com/) leads to a good
place. Hopefully I won't get fined.

Thanks for visiting! üíÉ
