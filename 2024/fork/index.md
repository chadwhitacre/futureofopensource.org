title: A Friendly Fork of Open Source is Coming
excerpt: "First there was Free Software, then Open Source. Now, get ready for a friendly fork: Fair Source."

A new brand of software sharing is splitting off of Open Source, along a seam
present since Day Zero. The new name is [Fair Source](https://fair.io/), and it
will free up companies to share their core software products like never before.
But first, it will cause some turbulence.

Many Open Source advocates will see the Fair Source friendly fork as a helpful
clarification that relieves the pressure we've seen year after year to change
the Open Source Definition
([latest](https://danb.me/blog/futo-open-source-definition/)). Unfortunately,
some will likely cast Fair Source as an enemy of Open Source. Let's not
let them carry the day. Fair Source and Open Source can and should be seen as
complementary approaches that both have their place.

Thankfully—remarkably—the key to Fair Source was _also_ present in 1998 on Day
Zero, the day when Free Software advocates capitalized on Netscape Navigator's
source code release to [create the Open Source
brand](https://opensource.org/history).

What is the seam? What is the key?

## The Seam Is Governance

Dirk Riehle, professor of Open Source software at University of Erlangen,
published an article in 2009 entitled, "[The Single-Vendor Commercial Open
Source Business
Model](https://dirkriehle.com/publications/2009-selected/the-commercial-open-source-business-model/)."
He distinguished [_commercial_ and
_community_ projects](https://dirkriehle.com/publications/2009-selected/the-commercial-open-source-business-model/#section3)
based on "their different control and ownership structures":

> - Community open source is open source that is controlled by a community of
>   stakeholders;
> - Single-vendor commercial open source is controlled by exactly one
>   stakeholder with the purpose of commercially exploiting it.

Notable examples of the latter in 2009 were MySQL, SugarCRM, Jaspersoft, and
Alfresco. There are many more examples today, including my employer, Sentry.

Already a year earlier, in 2008, Dirk had drawn attention to the confusion and
tensions that can arise from housing both models in the Open Source tent.
In "[The Perils of Going from Community to Commercial Open
Source](https://dirkriehle.com/2008/11/04/the-perils-of-going-from-community-to-commercial-open-source/),"
Dirk discussed the case of the now-forgotten TWiki. "[U]sing his root access
privileges, Peter Thoeny changed twiki.org, the main project website, to
implement a new governance model. [...] A few days later, the core developers
left the project and created a fork."

Change the name to HashiCorp or Redis, and we have the same controversy over
[relicensing and rug
pulls](https://openpath.chadwhitacre.com/2024/relicensing-and-rug-pulls/) today
as 16 years ago.

### The Gradual Rejection of COSS

The "single-vendor" article maintains a tone of academic neutrality. The
"perils" post leaks a little more negative sentiment: "community open source is
a temptation for startups to make a buck[.]" Dirk in that era seems guardedly
suspicious of commercial Open Source (COSS) but he does not outright reject the
concept. By his account, [SugarCRM coined the term in
2004](https://dirkriehle.com/2009/06/19/commercial-open-source-the-naming-confusion-remains/).
It is [still used today](https://www.coss.community/), most often in referrence
to [open
core](https://alampitt.typepad.com/lampitt_or_leave_it/2009/03/opencore-licensing-the-new-standard-in-commercial-software-business-models.html)
software, most often by [Joseph Jacks](https://x.com/josephjacks_) and [OSS
Capital](https://oss.capital/) portfolio companies. But trust has dwindled.

"[What's So Bad About the Open Core
Model?](https://dirkriehle.com/2019/11/11/whats-so-bad-about-the-open-core-model/)"
Dirk asked in 2019. "I suspect that a big part of the mistrust against the
open core model is directed at the single vendor case, as users suspect that
over time, the core will be turned into useless crippleware, as the open source
strategy to drive market adoption has run its course for the vendor."

By 2020, Dirk had grown comfortable shifting from neutrality to [value
judgement](https://dirkriehle.com/2020/03/12/please-help-keep-our-language-precise-single-vendor-open-source-is-neo-proprietary-source-not-closed-source/) (emphasis his):

> Community open source is the proper open source, open both in license and
> process. If you want to chide single-vendor open source as “not being proper
> community open source”, calling it closed source will only confuse.
>
> I offer <b>neo-proprietary</b> as a better term. Neo-proprietary captures the
> dominance and control of a proprietor in both the traditional closed source
> and the single-vendor open source case without confusing the two.

In 2023, he observed efforts to outright [exclude commercial Open Source from the Open
Source
Definition (OSD)](https://dirkriehle.com/publications/2023-selected/the-future-of-the-open-source-definition/):

> Both the closed governance and the copyright assignment are bothersome, even
> infuriating, to true open source enthusiasts. Vendor-owned open source has
> been called “faux-pen source software” (fake open-source software) or simply
> just a fraud.
>
> As a consequence, many such enthusiasts have asked that open source
> governance be added to the open source definition. Not just the artifact, but
> also the development process should be open, before some software should be
> called open-source software, and nobody should centralize the rights in the
> software in one controlled place."

Dirk is not alone. Thierry Carrez, vice-chair of the Open Source Initiative
(OSI), recently [took up Dirk's
offer](https://opensource.net/why-single-vendor-is-the-new-proprietary/) of a
term with which "to chide single-vendor open source as 'not being proper
community open source'":

> Beware of single-vendor Open Source software, it’s a proprietary development
> model that happens to temporarily use Open Source licensing. So yes, let’s
> all agree: Single vendor is the new proprietary.

Where did single-vendor come from? When did this tension arise?

### It Was There All Along

[Mozilla](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mozilla) was the first Open Source
project. Competing with Microsoft and losing badly, Jamie Zawinski (jwz) and
other Free Software advocates at Netscape convinced CEO Jim Barksdale and his
management team to try a desperate gambit: release the source code for the
Navigator web browser in order to attract a global workforce of volunteer
developers. Product lead Michael Toy [said at the
time](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Q7FTjhvZ7Y#t=4m08s), "We're probably
doomed. We're probably gonna fail. Microsoft is probably gonna squish us like a
bug anyway." Opening up Navigator was a marketing and product development Hail
Mary that Netscape agreed to out of desperation.

{% include img.html src="code_rush.webp" caption="There's an hour-long documentary about Netscape called <i>Code Rush</i>." url="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Q7FTjhvZ7Y" %}

Free Software advocates outside the company, including Eric Raymond (ESR) and
Bruce Perens, eagerly jumped in to help, but the parties had different motivations.
Netscape was making a last-ditch attempt to save the business. ESR,
jwz & co. were capitalizing on an opportunity to advance the Free Software
movement. Along the way they realized that "Free Software" confused people, so they
[rebranded](https://opensource.com/article/18/2/coining-term-open-source-software)
to "Open Source Software." It worked. The story caught fire, and Eric and Bruce
quickly formed the [Open Source Initiative](https://opensource.org/) (OSI) to
steward the new brand.

Now, Netscape published Mozilla under the [Netscape Public
License](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Netscape_Public_License), yet this
license was either never submitted to OSI or they rejected it. Why might the
Open Source Initiative have rejected the license of its flagship first project?

Richard Stallman (RMS) [documented the
reasons](https://www.gnu.org/philosophy/netscape-npl.html). Richard had founded
the Free Software movement in 1983. He did _not_ participate in the
Navigator release, and he [carefully
distinguished](https://www.gnu.org/philosophy/open-source-misses-the-point.html)
between Free Software and Open Source. RMS [pointed
out](https://www.gnu.org/philosophy/netscape-npl.html) that NPL-1.0 subtly
privileges Netscape:

> The first problem I noticed in the NPL was that it does not give Netscape and
> the rest of us equal rights, as the GNU GPL does. Under the NPL, we can use
> Netscape's code only as specified in the NPL, but Netscape can use our
> changes in any way at all—even in proprietary licensed versions of the
> software.
>
> [...]
>
> It denies the idea of cooperation among equals that our community rests on,
> and says that working on a free program means contributing to a proprietary
> software product.

Here is the relevant text from [NPL-1.0](https://spdx.org/licenses/NPL-1.0.html):

> V.2. Other Products. Netscape may include Covered Code in products other
> than the Netscape's Branded Code which are released by Netscape during the
> two (2) years following the release date of the Original Code, without such
> additional products becoming subject to the terms of this License, and may
> license such additional products on different terms from those contained in
> this License.
>
> V.3. Alternative Licensing. Netscape may license the Source Code of
> Netscape's Branded Code, including Modifications incorporated therein,
> without such additional products becoming subject to the terms of this
> License, and may license such additional products on different terms from
> those contained in this License.

It wasn't until [late 2001](https://wiki.mozilla.org/Timeline), after the dot-com
bubble had burst and Netscape had lost all relevance, that the community could
convince then-owner AOL Time Warner to [relicense
Mozilla](https://www-archive.mozilla.org/mpl/relicensing-faq) under a proper,
OSI-approved license.

**Open Source was born precisely as a tenuous alliance of
commercial and community interests**. The first Open Source project, Mozilla,
was a single-vendor commercial Open Source project. Dirk, Thierry, and others
who wish to chide, must chide Netscape. If single-vendor is to be written out
of the OSD, then the alliance has come to an end.

## The Key Is Delayed Open Source

With trust at an all-time low, the best option to resolve the tension between
community and single-vendor interests is to friendly-fork the Open Source brand. But,
can this be amicable? We've been together for 25 years! Companies with
single-vendor projects also run and participate in community projects. Most
developers use both. We're all part of the wider developer community and
technology industry.

The key to Fair Source is [delayed Open Source
publication](https://opensource.org/dosp). That is our olive branch to the
community activists to whom we're ceding the term Open Source. It's also our
offer to the wider developer community with whom we still identify. Karl Fogel
and coauthors [defined the term in a
whitepaper](https://opensource.org/delayed-open-source-publication) for the
Open Source Initiative (underwritten by Sentry):

> Delayed Open Source Publication (DOSP) is the practice of distributing or
> publicly deploying software under a proprietary license at first, then
> subsequently and in a planned fashion publishing that software’s source code
> under an Open Source license.

Also called "[eventual Open
Source](https://github.com/ftrotter/OSE/blob/a360875170b4a9818e3a4691beced81d7d5f13a8/OSELicense.asciidoc),"
the approach is gaining popularity through the
[BUSL](https://spdx.org/licenses/BUSL-1.1) and (Sentry's
own) [FSL](https://fsl.software/) licenses, but it has been around since the
beginning. The researchers credit GhostScript as the first to go this route, "around
1998" (p. 6).

### It Was There All Along

GhostScript may have been the first to put eventual Open Source into practice,
but the idea is on record even earlier, from Richard Stallman himself, in
of all things his March, 1998 [response to the release of the Netscape
Navigator source code](https://www.gnu.org/philosophy/netscape-npl.html)(!). After
observing the asymmetry in Netscape's license that effectively made Mozilla a
single-vendor commercial project, he offered this (emphasis mine):

> One proposed solution for this asymmetry is to **put a time limit on
> it—perhaps three or five years**. <b>That would be a big improvement</b>,
> because the time limit would deny the problematical deeper message.

What's more, if I'm reading the [NPL](https://spdx.org/licenses/NPL-1.0.html)
right, they _do_ have a time-box built in: "during the two (2) years following
the release date of the Original Code[.]" Coincidentally, two years is what we
settled on for [FSL](https://fsl.software/), tightening from the four-year
default in [BUSL](https://spdx.org/licenses/BUSL-1.1).

### Early Feedback Is Positive

Thankfully, some voices who would limit Open Source based on governance are
also seeing value in the Fair Source friendly fork.

- <b>Matt Wilson</b>, early Red Hat employee and long-time FOSS advocate,
  [offered the following
  summary](https://x.com/_msw_/status/1792710296957841408): "Fair Source
  provides as many of the benefits of Open Source that its producers are
  comfortable giving, while reserving and asserting a minimal set of exclusive
  rights to help achieve a sustainable business model."

- <b>Eric Raymond</b> was [initially
  skeptical](https://x.com/esrtweet/status/1790350881424056680) but [came
  around](https://x.com/esrtweet/status/1790870518456861153): "It's the guarantee
  of a timed flip to full open source that puts a bound on the business and legal
  risk. That's very clever."

- <b>Dan Brown</b>, maintainer of [Open Source Confusion
  Cases](https://github.com/ssddanbrown/Open-Source-Confusion-Cases/), has
  started [recommending Fair
  Source](https://x.com/ssddanbrown/status/1799801803871322607).

- <b>Adam Jacob</b>, co-founder of Chef and founder of System Initiative, gave
  the [call to adventure](https://x.com/adamhjk/status/1687113805237714944) a
  year ago that began this story arc. He recently
  [said](https://x.com/adamhjk/status/1790105587533099438), "I think 'Fair
  Source' is a good enough name."

- <b>Dirk Riehle</b> himself recently
  [noticed](https://dirkriehle.com/2024/02/07/what-about-skipping-the-open-source-part-in-commercial-open-source/)
  Fair Source early adopter GitButler: "It will be interesting to see whether GitButler
  can build a [Fair Source] community like commercial open source firms were
  able to build an open source community around their software."

My hope is that even strident voices such as <b>Thierry Carrez</b> can accept
the Fair Source fork as a good-faith attempt to resolve the tensions that have
been present within Open Source since Day Zero, "[to go beyond the rant &
provide an alternative](https://x.com/tcarrez/status/1764220293319393559)."

So far, Thierry has been
[dismissive](https://opensource.net/why-single-vendor-is-the-new-proprietary/)
of the delayed Open Source approach: "Imagine a world where you have to run a
buggy two-year-old version with known vulnerabilities because that’s the Open
Source one." Opposing his objection are the [10,000+ organizations that
self-host
Sentry](https://openpath.chadwhitacre.com/2024/widespread-use-of-a-fair-source-product/),
which has been eventually Open Source—what we now call Fair Source—for five
years. Fair Source confers real benefits today, and meaningfully protects
against [vendor lockin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vendor_lock-in) and
[platform decay](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enshittification). No, you're
not expected to run a buggy two-year-old version. You're expected to run
today's version today, and if push comes to shove to fork the two-year-old
version and take it in a different direction.

## Help Shape Fair Source

Dirk asked in 2021, "[What’s next after
'source-available'?](https://dirkriehle.com/2021/10/05/whats-next-after-source-available/)"
Our answer is [Fair Source](https://fair.io/). In this post I've presented the
historical case for friendly-forking, and for a key feature, eventual Open Source.
There's much more to define and design. [Join us on
GitHub](https://github.com/fairsource/fair.io/issues/14) to participate. You
can also [subscribe there](https://github.com/fairsource/fair.io/issues/14) or
[on X](https://x.com/fairsrc) for updates.

The net effect of Fair Source will be more code out in the world, more
[sustainability for
developers](https://blog.sentry.io/sentrys-open-source-values/), and less
pressure to change the Open Source Definition in one direction or another. Our
tenuous alliance of commercial and community interests has gotten us where we
are today—which is really far. Let's see it as a sign of success that we're now
ready for community projects and single-vendor projects to go even further in
parallel: Open Source _and_ Fair Source.
