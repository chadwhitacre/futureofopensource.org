Solving the [Open Source sustainability
crisis](/2024/the-open-source-sustainability-crisis/) has two main parts:

1. unlocking funding from corporations and governments, and
2. properly allocating funds to individual maintainers.

Both are hard. I've talked elsewhere about the [three basic approaches to
solving the first problem](https://spectrum.ieee.org/open-source-crisis). The
[Open Source Pledge](https://opensourcepledge.com/) is one implementation of
one of the approaches. In this post I want to talk about the second part:
assuming funds are flowing, how should we allocate them?

Let's start by defining our policy goal: **Allocations should reward
individuals fairly for past contributions and motivate individuals to make the
best future contributions.**
